IN PARTICULAR, THE ADVISER FAILED TO CO-INVEST IN TWO CDOS DESPITE THE FACT THAT THREE PROGRAM CLIENTS INVESTED IN THE EQUITY TRANCHES OF THOSE CDOS. IN 2005, THE ADVISER BEGAN AN INVESTMENT ADVISORY PROGRAM. UNDER THE PROGRAM, THE ADVISER AND ITS CLIENTS SIGNED INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS UNDER WHICH THE ADVISER AGREED TO RENDER INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES, AND THE CLIENT AGREED TO COMMIT TO INVEST IN THE EQUITY TRANCHE OF CERTAIN UPCOMING CDO OR CLO DEALS THAT WOULD BE MANAGED BY THE ADVISER. THE ADVISER REPRESENTED TO ITS PROGRAM CLIENTS THAT IT WAS SERVING AS THEIR INVESTMENT ADVISER AND DISCLOSED TO THE COMMISSION ON ITS FORM ADV THAT PROGRAM ACCOUNTS WERE A TYPE OF SEPARATELY MANAGED ACCOUNT. THE ADVISER DID NOT RECEIVE ADVISORY FEES DIRECTLY FROM PROGRAM CLIENTS; RATHER THE ADVISER INFORMED ITS CLIENTS AND THE COMMISSION ON ITS FORM ADV THAT IT WOULD BE COMPENSATED FROM THE MANAGEMENT FEES THAT IT EARNED THROUGH MANAGING THE CDOS THAT ITS CLIENTS INVESTED IN. ALADDIN CAPITAL PLACED THE EQUITY INTEREST WITH THE CLIENT AND TYPICALLY RECEIVED A NEGOTIATED (USUALLY TEN-PERCENT) PLACEMENT FEE OR COMMISSION FROM THE CDOS' OR CLOS' UNDERWRITER FOR DOING SO. WHEN MARKETING THE PROGRAM, THE ADVISER AND ALADDIN CAPITAL STATED THAT THE ADVISER WOULD CO-INVEST IN THE SAME EQUITY TRANCHES OF EACH CDO OR CLO ALONGSIDE ITS CLIENTS. THE ADVISER'S CO-INVESTMENT REPRESENTATION WAS A KEY FEATURE OF, AND SELLING POINT FOR, THE PROGRAM. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ADVISER EXPLAINED IN MARKETING MATERIAL THAT, \\\"[W]E ALIGN OUR INTERESTS WITH PROGRAM INVESTORS BY CO-INVESTING IN EVERY TRANSACTION WITH THEM. AND DON'T FORGET, WE ARE NOT INVESTING IN OTHER FIRMS' TRANSACTIONS. INSTEAD, WE ONLY INVEST IN DEALS WHERE WE CAN CONTROL THE MANAGEMENT OF THE COLLATERAL - OUR OWN PROGRAMS.\\\" IN THE SAME MARKETING PIECE, THE ADVISER ALSO POSED THE QUESTION, \\\"[W]HY IS AN INVESTOR BETTER OFF JUST INVESTING IN ADVISER SPONSORED CLOS AND CDOS?\\\" THE ADVISER ANSWERED BY EMPHASIZING THAT THE \\\"MOST POWERFUL RESPONSE I CAN GIVE TO YOUR QUESTION IS THAT THE ADVISER CO-INVESTS ALONGSIDE PROGRAM INVESTORS IN EVERY PROGRAM. PUTTING MEANINGFUL 'SKIN IN THE GAME' AS WE DO MEANS OUR FINANCIAL INTERESTS ARE ALIGNED WITH THOSE OF OUR PROGRAM INVESTORS.\\\" ALADDIN CAPITAL ALSO EMPHASIZED THAT THE ADVISER WOULD CO-INVEST IN THE SAME PRODUCTS WHEN MARKETING SPECIFIC CDOS TO POTENTIAL PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS.

THE AMLCO RECEIVED ALERTS FROM THE CLEARING FIRM REGARDING INDIVIDUALS AND ENTITIES WITH SECURITIES-RELATED DISCIPLINARY HISTORIES AND WAS ALSO AWARE OF THE TRADING IN CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS AT THE FIRM. HOWEVER, THE FIRM, ACTING THROUGH THE AMLCO, FAILED TO ADEQUATELY IDENTIFY, INVESTIGATE AND RESPOND TO THE SUSPICIOUS TRADING ACTIVITY RELATED TO THESE CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS.

WHEN FACED WITH MANY OF THE RED FLAGS IDENTIFIED IN THE FIRM'S AML PROCEDURES, NEITHER THE AMLCO NOR ANYONE ELSE AT THE FIRM TOOK STEPS TO INVESTIGATE FURTHER OR GATHER INFORMATION TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE TRANSACTIONS HAD LEGITIMATE PURPOSES OR CONSTITUTED SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY. THE FIRM, ACTING THROUGH THE AMLCO, FAILED TO ENFORCE ITS WRITTEN AML PROGRAM TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THE BANK SECRECY ACT. THE AMLCO FAILED TO IDENTIFY MULTIPLE TRANSACTIONS IN CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS WHICH TRIGGERED MANY OF THE RED FLAGS IDENTIFIED IN THE FIRM'S AML PROCEDURES. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THESE CUSTOMERS MAINTAINED MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS, HAD SECURITIES- RELATED DISCIPLINARY HISTORIES, ENGAGED IN SUSPICIOUS PENNY STOCK TRADES AND CONDUCTED QUESTIONABLE THIRD-PARTY WIRE ACTIVITY. CONTRARY TO ITS AML PROCEDURES, THE FIRM DID NOT USE THE EXCEPTION REPORTS OFFERED BY ITS CLEARING FIRM, WHICH INCLUDED REPORTS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN USED TO MONITOR WIRE ACTIVITY. THE FIRM ALSO DID NOT IMPLEMENT ANY OF ITS OWN REPORTS FOR THE REVIEW OF TRADING ACTIVITY. IN MONITORING FOR SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY, THE FIRM, THROUGH THE AMLCO, RELIED MAINLY ON A DAILY REVIEW OF CUSTOMER TRADES, WHICH IS INADEQUATE FOR IDENTIFYING SUSPICIOUS PATTERNS OF TRADING ACTIVITY OR OTHER AML ISSUES. THE FIRM BEGAN USING AN INCOMING PENNY STOCK QUESTIONNAIRE, PROVIDED BY ITS CLEARING FIRM WHICH WAS INTENDED TO DOCUMENT THE SOURCE OF THE SHARES AND CONFIRM THAT THE SHARES WERE REGISTERED. EVEN WHEN THE QUESTIONNAIRE CONTAINED INFORMATION WARRANTING FURTHER INQUIRY, THE FIRM FAILED TO CONDUCT THE NECESSARY FOLLOW UP. THE FIRM, ACTING THROUGH ITS AMLCO, ALSO FAILED TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT OTHER COMPONENTS OF A REASONABLY DESIGNED AML COMPLIANCE PROGRAM (AMLCP), INCLUDING FAILING TO PROPERLY RESPOND TO REQUESTS UNDER SECTION 314(A) OF THE USA PATRIOT ACT OF 2001. THE FINANCIAL CRIMES ENFORCEMENT NETWORK (FINCEN) BEGAN ISSUING INFORMATION REQUESTS UNDER THIS NEW AUTHORITY. THE FIRM DID NOT IMPLEMENT A SYSTEM TO RESPOND TO FINCEN 314(A) REQUESTS AND HAS NOT SHOWN THAT SUCH REVIEWS WERE EVEN CONDUCTED.

WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING THE FINDINGS, THE FIRM CONSENTED TO THE SANCTIONS AND TO THE ENTRY OF FINDINGS THAT ITS RELIANCE UPON THE LIMITED NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS FROM AN ENTITY WITH COMMON OWNERSHIP TO REMOTELY CONDUCT ALL OF THE SUPERVISORY AND COMPLIANCE FUNCTIONS FOR THE FIRM'S INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR OPERATED BRANCH OFFICES, WHILE ALSO CONDUCTING THOSE SAME FUNCTIONS FOR AFFILIATED ENTITIES, WAS NOT REASONABLE. THE FINDINGS STATED THAT THE FIRM'S SYSTEM FOR REVIEWING THE EMAILS OF ITS REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVES WAS NOT REASONABLY DESIGNED AND RESULTED IN INADEQUATE SUPERVISION OF THE FIRM'S EMAIL COMMUNICATIONS. IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT REPRESENTATIVES WERE REPORTING CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS, THE FIRM RELIED UPON ITS EMAIL REVIEW AND BRANCH OFFICE INSPECTION SYSTEMS. THE FIRM'S RELIANCE UPON THESE SYSTEMS AS CONTROLS TO ENSURE THE REPORTING OF CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS WAS NOT REASONABLE. THE FINDINGS ALSO STATED THAT THE FIRM FAILED TO MAINTAIN A CENTRALIZED LOG OF THE GIFTS AND GRATUITIES RECEIVED AND REPORTED BY THE FIRM'S REPRESENTATIVES AND FAILED TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN AN ADEQUATE SYSTEM OF SUPERVISION CONCERNING THE RECEIPT AND REPORTING OF GIFTS AND GRATUITIES BY ITS REPRESENTATIVES. THE FIRM DID NOT REVIEW LOGS MAINTAINED IN BRANCH OFFICES AS PART OF ITS BRANCH INSPECTION PROCESS, OR OTHERWISE REVIEW OR VERIFY THE INFORMATION ON SUCH GIFT LOGS. THE FINDINGS ALSO INCLUDED THAT THE FIRM WAS UNABLE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IT HAD CONDUCTED REVIEWS OF DISCLOSED OUTSIDE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES TO ENSURE THAT SUCH DISCLOSURES COMPLIED WITH THE NEW STANDARDS IN FINRA RULE 3270. THE FIRM FAILED TO UPDATE ITS WRITTEN SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES (WSPS) RELATING TO THE REVIEW AND ASSESSMENT OF OUTSIDE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. THE FIRM UTILIZED A FORM TO COLLECT INFORMATION FROM ITS REPRESENTATIVES CONCERNING THEIR OUTSIDE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES BUT FAILED TO REQUEST INFORMATION SUFFICIENT TO DETECT THE OCCURRENCE OF PRIVATE SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AWAY FROM THE FIRM AND FAILED TO INCLUDE QUESTIONS THAT WOULD HAVE ENABLED THE FIRM TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE REPRESENTATIVE WAS CONDUCTING THE OUTSIDE BUSINESS ACTIVITY IN A MANNER THAT COULD LEAD CUSTOMERS OR THE GENERAL PUBLIC TO MISTAKENLY BELIEVE IT WAS AN ACTIVITY SPONSORED OR SUPERVISED BY THE FIRM. THE FIRM WAS AWARE THAT REPRESENTATIVES WERE PARTICIPATING IN SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS THROUGH THEIR APPROVED REGISTERED INVESTMENT ADVISORS (RIAS) BUT IT DID NOT RECORD OR MAINTAIN THE RIAS' SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS ON THE FIRM'S BOOKS AND RECORDS, OR SUPERVISE THE CORRESPONDENCE OF THE RIAS. THOUGH THE REPRESENTATIVES WERE ALLOWED TO ENGAGE IN PRIVATE SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AWAY FROM THE FIRM THROUGH THEIR RIAS, THE FIRM DID NOT UPDATE ITS WSPS, WHICH EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED SUCH ACTIVITY. FINRA FOUND THAT THE FIRM FAILED TO CONDUCT ANY INDEPENDENT DUE DILIGENCE FOR THE STRUCTURED PRODUCTS IT RECOMMENDED TO CUSTOMERS. INSTEAD, THE FIRM RELIED COMPLETELY ON THE DETERMINATION OF ITS FIXED INCOME DISTRIBUTORS TO SELL THE STRUCTURED PRODUCTS AS SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE OF SUITABILITY. THE FIRM FAILED TO IMPLEMENT AND MAINTAIN WSPS AND A SYSTEM FOR EVALUATING WHETHER THESE COMPLEX PRODUCTS WERE APPROPRIATE FOR ITS CUSTOMERS. FINRA ALSO FOUND THAT WITH RESPECT TO DIRECT APPLICATION-WAY BUSINESS, THE FIRM FAILED TO MONITOR FOR CHANGES IN CUSTOMER ADDRESSES AS REQUIRED BY ITS WSPS AND FAILED TO MAINTAIN OR ENFORCE AN ADEQUATE SUPERVISORY SYSTEM TO MONITOR FOR CUSTOMER CHANGES OF ADDRESS.

BATS RULES 3.1, 3.2, 5.1, 5.3, 5.4: THE FIRM FAILED TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN A SUPERVISORY SYSTEM, INCLUDING WRITTEN SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES (WSPS), REASONABLY DESIGNED TO ACHIEVE COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS, AND APPLICABLE BATS RULES, PROHIBITING MANIPULATIVE TRADING ACTIVITY, AND TO DETECT AND PREVENT A PATTERN OF MANIPULATIVE TRADING ACTIVITY IDENTIFIED ON U.S. MARKETS REFERRED TO AS \\\"LAYERING\\\", NOTWITHSTANDING MULTIPLE INDICATIONS FROM OVERSEAS REGULATORS, U.S. REGULATORS, AND FIRM STAFF, THAT TRADERS WERE ENGAGED IN POTENTIAL LAYERING, AND THAT SUCH CONDUCT WAS PROHIBITED IN THE U.S. THE FIRM DID NOT TAKE ANY STEPS TO MONITOR TRADERS FOR SUCH ACTIVITY. ONCE IMPLEMENTED, THROUGH THE FIRST FULL MONTH OF ITS OPERATION ALONE, THE LAYERING REPORT FLAGGED MULTIPLE INSTANCES OF POTENTIAL LAYERING BY TRADERS ON OVERSEAS MARKETS. THE LAYERING REPORT DID NOT SURVEIL FOR POTENTIAL LAYERING ACTIVITY ON U.S. MARKETS BECAUSE THE FIRM'S PRESIDENT AND PRINCIPAL CONCLUDED THAT LAYERING WAS NOT PROHIBITED IN THE U.S. THE PRESIDENT ASSERTED THAT HE LOOKED INTO THE ISSUE OF LAYERING IN THE U.S. EARLY ON IN 2007 WHEN A REGULATOR FIRST RAISED THE ISSUE WITH THE FIRM, AND CONCLUDED THAT LAYERING WAS PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE ON U.S. MARKETS. THE PRESIDENT COULD OFFER NO AUTHORITY FOR HIS CONCLUSION, AND FAILED TO TAKE EVEN THE SIMPLEST OF STEPS TO DETERMINE WHETHER LAYERING WAS PROHIBITED IN THE U.S. INQUIRIES FROM U.S. REGULATORS FOR ORDER AND TRADE DATA WERE NOT THE ONLY INDICATIONS RECEIVED BY THE FIRM THAT LAYERING WAS PROHIBITED IN THE U.S. ON THREE OCCASIONS, A FIRM STAFFER ADVISED THE PRESIDENT AND THE FIRM THAT, IN HIS OPINION, LAYERING WAS PROHIBITED IN THE U.S. NO ACTION WAS TAKEN BY EITHER THE FIRM OR PRESIDENT IN RESPONSE TO HIS WARNINGS. THE FIRM, THROUGH THE PRESIDENT, FAILED TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN A SUPERVISORY SYSTEM, INCLUDING WSPS, REASONABLY DESIGNED TO DETECT AND PREVENT MANIPULATIVE ACTIVITY DESIGNED TO AFFECT THE CLOSING PRICE OF A SECURITY. NO CONTROLS WERE IMPLEMENTED TO PREVENT TRADERS FROM TRADING AFTER THE CLOSE OF THE MARKET, AND FIRM STAFF TESTIFIED THAT TRADERS WERE, IN FACT, ALLOWED TO TRADE AFTER 4 PM TO TRADE OUT OF ANY OPEN POSITIONS THEY HAD. ACCORDING TO FIRM STAFF, THE FIRM'S TRADING SYSTEM IN THE U.S. WOULD NOT SHUT DOWN UNTIL AFTER THE MARKET CLOSED, DEPENDING ON HOW QUICKLY TRADERS FLATTENED THEIR POSITIONS. THE FIRM, HOWEVER, FAILED TO IMPLEMENT ANY REVIEW OF TRADERS' TRADING ACTIVITY REASONABLY DESIGNED TO DETECT AND PREVENT MANIPULATION OF THE CLOSING PRICE OF A SECURITY. THE FIRM FAILED TO TAKE ANY STEPS TO TEST ITS TRADING WITH OTHERS REPORT (TWO REPORT). THE FIRM BECAME AWARE THAT THE TWO REPORT WAS NOT FUNCTIONING AS INTENDED IN CONNECTION WITH RESPONDING TO A FINRA INQUIRY. UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION, THE FIRM DISCOVERED THAT THE TWO REPORT MATERIALLY UNDERREPORTED THE NUMBER OF MATCHED TRADES EXECUTED BY TRADERS AS A RESULT OF A PROGRAMMING ERROR. THE PROGRAMMING FOR THE TWO REPORT WAS CORRECTED AND ALTHOUGH THE FIRM RERAN THE TWO REPORT, IT NEVER REVIEWED THE RERUN REPORTS TO DETERMINE WHETHER ANY TRADERS HAD ENGAGED IN A PATTERN OF MATCHED TRADES. DESPITE THE SIGNIFICANT ROLE PLAYED BY TRADER IDS IN FIRM SUPERVISORY AND RISK MONITORING SYSTEMS, THE FIRM HAD NO EFFECTIVE CONTROLS RELATING TO THE DE-ACTIVATION OF TRADER IDS BELONGING TO TERMINATED TRADERS, NOR DID THE FIRM HAVE CONTROLS TO ENSURE TRADER IDS WERE USED EXCLUSIVELY BY THE PERSONS TO WHOM THEY WERE ISSUED. AS A RESULT OF THIS SITUATION, TRADERS POTENTIALLY WERE ABLE TO CIRCUMVENT THE SUPERVISORY AND RISK CONTROLS TIED TO TRADER IDS, INCLUDING: CONTINUING TO TRADE AFTER THEIR OWN TRADER IDS WERE DISABLED DUE TO LOSSES BY USING OTHER TRADER IDS, AND CONTINUING TO TRADE AFTER THEY WERE SUSPENDED FOR DISCIPLINARY REASONS BY ENTERING TRADES USING OTHER TRADER IDS.

IN PARTICULAR, THE ADVISER FAILED TO CO-INVEST IN TWO CDOS DESPITE THE FACT THAT THREE PROGRAM CLIENTS INVESTED IN THE EQUITY TRANCHES OF THOSE CDOS. IN 2005, THE ADVISER BEGAN AN INVESTMENT ADVISORY PROGRAM. UNDER THE PROGRAM, THE ADVISER AND ITS CLIENTS SIGNED INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS UNDER WHICH THE ADVISER AGREED TO RENDER INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES, AND THE CLIENT AGREED TO COMMIT TO INVEST IN THE EQUITY TRANCHE OF CERTAIN UPCOMING CDO OR CLO DEALS THAT WOULD BE MANAGED BY THE ADVISER. THE ADVISER REPRESENTED TO ITS PROGRAM CLIENTS THAT IT WAS SERVING AS THEIR INVESTMENT ADVISER AND DISCLOSED TO THE COMMISSION ON ITS FORM ADV THAT PROGRAM ACCOUNTS WERE A TYPE OF SEPARATELY MANAGED ACCOUNT. THE ADVISER DID NOT RECEIVE ADVISORY FEES DIRECTLY FROM PROGRAM CLIENTS; RATHER THE ADVISER INFORMED ITS CLIENTS AND THE COMMISSION ON ITS FORM ADV THAT IT WOULD BE COMPENSATED FROM THE MANAGEMENT FEES THAT IT EARNED THROUGH MANAGING THE CDOS THAT ITS CLIENTS INVESTED IN. ALADDIN CAPITAL PLACED THE EQUITY INTEREST WITH THE CLIENT AND TYPICALLY RECEIVED A NEGOTIATED (USUALLY TEN-PERCENT) PLACEMENT FEE OR COMMISSION FROM THE CDOS' OR CLOS' UNDERWRITER FOR DOING SO. WHEN MARKETING THE PROGRAM, THE ADVISER AND ALADDIN CAPITAL STATED THAT THE ADVISER WOULD CO-INVEST IN THE SAME EQUITY TRANCHES OF EACH CDO OR CLO ALONGSIDE ITS CLIENTS. THE ADVISER'S CO-INVESTMENT REPRESENTATION WAS A KEY FEATURE OF, AND SELLING POINT FOR, THE PROGRAM. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ADVISER EXPLAINED IN MARKETING MATERIAL THAT, \\\"[W]E ALIGN OUR INTERESTS WITH PROGRAM INVESTORS BY CO-INVESTING IN EVERY TRANSACTION WITH THEM. AND DON'T FORGET, WE ARE NOT INVESTING IN OTHER FIRMS' TRANSACTIONS. INSTEAD, WE ONLY INVEST IN DEALS WHERE WE CAN CONTROL THE MANAGEMENT OF THE COLLATERAL - OUR OWN PROGRAMS.\\\" IN THE SAME MARKETING PIECE, THE ADVISER ALSO POSED THE QUESTION, \\\"[W]HY IS AN INVESTOR BETTER OFF JUST INVESTING IN ADVISER SPONSORED CLOS AND CDOS?\\\" THE ADVISER ANSWERED BY EMPHASIZING THAT THE \\\"MOST POWERFUL RESPONSE I CAN GIVE TO YOUR QUESTION IS THAT THE ADVISER CO-INVESTS ALONGSIDE PROGRAM INVESTORS IN EVERY PROGRAM. PUTTING MEANINGFUL 'SKIN IN THE GAME' AS WE DO MEANS OUR FINANCIAL INTERESTS ARE ALIGNED WITH THOSE OF OUR PROGRAM INVESTORS.\\\" ALADDIN CAPITAL ALSO EMPHASIZED THAT THE ADVISER WOULD CO-INVEST IN THE SAME PRODUCTS WHEN MARKETING SPECIFIC CDOS TO POTENTIAL PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS.

THE AMLCO RECEIVED ALERTS FROM THE CLEARING FIRM REGARDING INDIVIDUALS AND ENTITIES WITH SECURITIES-RELATED DISCIPLINARY HISTORIES AND WAS ALSO AWARE OF THE TRADING IN CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS AT THE FIRM. HOWEVER, THE FIRM, ACTING THROUGH THE AMLCO, FAILED TO ADEQUATELY IDENTIFY, INVESTIGATE AND RESPOND TO THE SUSPICIOUS TRADING ACTIVITY RELATED TO THESE CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS.

WHEN FACED WITH MANY OF THE RED FLAGS IDENTIFIED IN THE FIRM'S AML PROCEDURES, NEITHER THE AMLCO NOR ANYONE ELSE AT THE FIRM TOOK STEPS TO INVESTIGATE FURTHER OR GATHER INFORMATION TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE TRANSACTIONS HAD LEGITIMATE PURPOSES OR CONSTITUTED SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY. THE FIRM, ACTING THROUGH THE AMLCO, FAILED TO ENFORCE ITS WRITTEN AML PROGRAM TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THE BANK SECRECY ACT. THE AMLCO FAILED TO IDENTIFY MULTIPLE TRANSACTIONS IN CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS WHICH TRIGGERED MANY OF THE RED FLAGS IDENTIFIED IN THE FIRM'S AML PROCEDURES. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THESE CUSTOMERS MAINTAINED MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS, HAD SECURITIES- RELATED DISCIPLINARY HISTORIES, ENGAGED IN SUSPICIOUS PENNY STOCK TRADES AND CONDUCTED QUESTIONABLE THIRD-PARTY WIRE ACTIVITY. CONTRARY TO ITS AML PROCEDURES, THE FIRM DID NOT USE THE EXCEPTION REPORTS OFFERED BY ITS CLEARING FIRM, WHICH INCLUDED REPORTS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN USED TO MONITOR WIRE ACTIVITY. THE FIRM ALSO DID NOT IMPLEMENT ANY OF ITS OWN REPORTS FOR THE REVIEW OF TRADING ACTIVITY. IN MONITORING FOR SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY, THE FIRM, THROUGH THE AMLCO, RELIED MAINLY ON A DAILY REVIEW OF CUSTOMER TRADES, WHICH IS INADEQUATE FOR IDENTIFYING SUSPICIOUS PATTERNS OF TRADING ACTIVITY OR OTHER AML ISSUES. THE FIRM BEGAN USING AN INCOMING PENNY STOCK QUESTIONNAIRE, PROVIDED BY ITS CLEARING FIRM WHICH WAS INTENDED TO DOCUMENT THE SOURCE OF THE SHARES AND CONFIRM THAT THE SHARES WERE REGISTERED. EVEN WHEN THE QUESTIONNAIRE CONTAINED INFORMATION WARRANTING FURTHER INQUIRY, THE FIRM FAILED TO CONDUCT THE NECESSARY FOLLOW UP. THE FIRM, ACTING THROUGH ITS AMLCO, ALSO FAILED TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT OTHER COMPONENTS OF A REASONABLY DESIGNED AML COMPLIANCE PROGRAM (AMLCP), INCLUDING FAILING TO PROPERLY RESPOND TO REQUESTS UNDER SECTION 314(A) OF THE USA PATRIOT ACT OF 2001. THE FINANCIAL CRIMES ENFORCEMENT NETWORK (FINCEN) BEGAN ISSUING INFORMATION REQUESTS UNDER THIS NEW AUTHORITY. THE FIRM DID NOT IMPLEMENT A SYSTEM TO RESPOND TO FINCEN 314(A) REQUESTS AND HAS NOT SHOWN THAT SUCH REVIEWS WERE EVEN CONDUCTED.

WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING THE FINDINGS, THE FIRM CONSENTED TO THE SANCTIONS AND TO THE ENTRY OF FINDINGS THAT ITS RELIANCE UPON THE LIMITED NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS FROM AN ENTITY WITH COMMON OWNERSHIP TO REMOTELY CONDUCT ALL OF THE SUPERVISORY AND COMPLIANCE FUNCTIONS FOR THE FIRM'S INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR OPERATED BRANCH OFFICES, WHILE ALSO CONDUCTING THOSE SAME FUNCTIONS FOR AFFILIATED ENTITIES, WAS NOT REASONABLE. THE FINDINGS STATED THAT THE FIRM'S SYSTEM FOR REVIEWING THE EMAILS OF ITS REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVES WAS NOT REASONABLY DESIGNED AND RESULTED IN INADEQUATE SUPERVISION OF THE FIRM'S EMAIL COMMUNICATIONS. IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT REPRESENTATIVES WERE REPORTING CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS, THE FIRM RELIED UPON ITS EMAIL REVIEW AND BRANCH OFFICE INSPECTION SYSTEMS. THE FIRM'S RELIANCE UPON THESE SYSTEMS AS CONTROLS TO ENSURE THE REPORTING OF CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS WAS NOT REASONABLE. THE FINDINGS ALSO STATED THAT THE FIRM FAILED TO MAINTAIN A CENTRALIZED LOG OF THE GIFTS AND GRATUITIES RECEIVED AND REPORTED BY THE FIRM'S REPRESENTATIVES AND FAILED TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN AN ADEQUATE SYSTEM OF SUPERVISION CONCERNING THE RECEIPT AND REPORTING OF GIFTS AND GRATUITIES BY ITS REPRESENTATIVES. THE FIRM DID NOT REVIEW LOGS MAINTAINED IN BRANCH OFFICES AS PART OF ITS BRANCH INSPECTION PROCESS, OR OTHERWISE REVIEW OR VERIFY THE INFORMATION ON SUCH GIFT LOGS. THE FINDINGS ALSO INCLUDED THAT THE FIRM WAS UNABLE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IT HAD CONDUCTED REVIEWS OF DISCLOSED OUTSIDE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES TO ENSURE THAT SUCH DISCLOSURES COMPLIED WITH THE NEW STANDARDS IN FINRA RULE 3270. THE FIRM FAILED TO UPDATE ITS WRITTEN SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES (WSPS) RELATING TO THE REVIEW AND ASSESSMENT OF OUTSIDE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. THE FIRM UTILIZED A FORM TO COLLECT INFORMATION FROM ITS REPRESENTATIVES CONCERNING THEIR OUTSIDE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES BUT FAILED TO REQUEST INFORMATION SUFFICIENT TO DETECT THE OCCURRENCE OF PRIVATE SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AWAY FROM THE FIRM AND FAILED TO INCLUDE QUESTIONS THAT WOULD HAVE ENABLED THE FIRM TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE REPRESENTATIVE WAS CONDUCTING THE OUTSIDE BUSINESS ACTIVITY IN A MANNER THAT COULD LEAD CUSTOMERS OR THE GENERAL PUBLIC TO MISTAKENLY BELIEVE IT WAS AN ACTIVITY SPONSORED OR SUPERVISED BY THE FIRM. THE FIRM WAS AWARE THAT REPRESENTATIVES WERE PARTICIPATING IN SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS THROUGH THEIR APPROVED REGISTERED INVESTMENT ADVISORS (RIAS) BUT IT DID NOT RECORD OR MAINTAIN THE RIAS' SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS ON THE FIRM'S BOOKS AND RECORDS, OR SUPERVISE THE CORRESPONDENCE OF THE RIAS. THOUGH THE REPRESENTATIVES WERE ALLOWED TO ENGAGE IN PRIVATE SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AWAY FROM THE FIRM THROUGH THEIR RIAS, THE FIRM DID NOT UPDATE ITS WSPS, WHICH EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED SUCH ACTIVITY. FINRA FOUND THAT THE FIRM FAILED TO CONDUCT ANY INDEPENDENT DUE DILIGENCE FOR THE STRUCTURED PRODUCTS IT RECOMMENDED TO CUSTOMERS. INSTEAD, THE FIRM RELIED COMPLETELY ON THE DETERMINATION OF ITS FIXED INCOME DISTRIBUTORS TO SELL THE STRUCTURED PRODUCTS AS SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE OF SUITABILITY. THE FIRM FAILED TO IMPLEMENT AND MAINTAIN WSPS AND A SYSTEM FOR EVALUATING WHETHER THESE COMPLEX PRODUCTS WERE APPROPRIATE FOR ITS CUSTOMERS. FINRA ALSO FOUND THAT WITH RESPECT TO DIRECT APPLICATION-WAY BUSINESS, THE FIRM FAILED TO MONITOR FOR CHANGES IN CUSTOMER ADDRESSES AS REQUIRED BY ITS WSPS AND FAILED TO MAINTAIN OR ENFORCE AN ADEQUATE SUPERVISORY SYSTEM TO MONITOR FOR CUSTOMER CHANGES OF ADDRESS.

BATS RULES 3.1, 3.2, 5.1, 5.3, 5.4: THE FIRM FAILED TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN A SUPERVISORY SYSTEM, INCLUDING WRITTEN SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES (WSPS), REASONABLY DESIGNED TO ACHIEVE COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS, AND APPLICABLE BATS RULES, PROHIBITING MANIPULATIVE TRADING ACTIVITY, AND TO DETECT AND PREVENT A PATTERN OF MANIPULATIVE TRADING ACTIVITY IDENTIFIED ON U.S. MARKETS REFERRED TO AS \\\"LAYERING\\\", NOTWITHSTANDING MULTIPLE INDICATIONS FROM OVERSEAS REGULATORS, U.S. REGULATORS, AND FIRM STAFF, THAT TRADERS WERE ENGAGED IN POTENTIAL LAYERING, AND THAT SUCH CONDUCT WAS PROHIBITED IN THE U.S. THE FIRM DID NOT TAKE ANY STEPS TO MONITOR TRADERS FOR SUCH ACTIVITY. ONCE IMPLEMENTED, THROUGH THE FIRST FULL MONTH OF ITS OPERATION ALONE, THE LAYERING REPORT FLAGGED MULTIPLE INSTANCES OF POTENTIAL LAYERING BY TRADERS ON OVERSEAS MARKETS. THE LAYERING REPORT DID NOT SURVEIL FOR POTENTIAL LAYERING ACTIVITY ON U.S. MARKETS BECAUSE THE FIRM'S PRESIDENT AND PRINCIPAL CONCLUDED THAT LAYERING WAS NOT PROHIBITED IN THE U.S. THE PRESIDENT ASSERTED THAT HE LOOKED INTO THE ISSUE OF LAYERING IN THE U.S. EARLY ON IN 2007 WHEN A REGULATOR FIRST RAISED THE ISSUE WITH THE FIRM, AND CONCLUDED THAT LAYERING WAS PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE ON U.S. MARKETS. THE PRESIDENT COULD OFFER NO AUTHORITY FOR HIS CONCLUSION, AND FAILED TO TAKE EVEN THE SIMPLEST OF STEPS TO DETERMINE WHETHER LAYERING WAS PROHIBITED IN THE U.S. INQUIRIES FROM U.S. REGULATORS FOR ORDER AND TRADE DATA WERE NOT THE ONLY INDICATIONS RECEIVED BY THE FIRM THAT LAYERING WAS PROHIBITED IN THE U.S. ON THREE OCCASIONS, A FIRM STAFFER ADVISED THE PRESIDENT AND THE FIRM THAT, IN HIS OPINION, LAYERING WAS PROHIBITED IN THE U.S. NO ACTION WAS TAKEN BY EITHER THE FIRM OR PRESIDENT IN RESPONSE TO HIS WARNINGS. THE FIRM, THROUGH THE PRESIDENT, FAILED TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN A SUPERVISORY SYSTEM, INCLUDING WSPS, REASONABLY DESIGNED TO DETECT AND PREVENT MANIPULATIVE ACTIVITY DESIGNED TO AFFECT THE CLOSING PRICE OF A SECURITY. NO CONTROLS WERE IMPLEMENTED TO PREVENT TRADERS FROM TRADING AFTER THE CLOSE OF THE MARKET, AND FIRM STAFF TESTIFIED THAT TRADERS WERE, IN FACT, ALLOWED TO TRADE AFTER 4 PM TO TRADE OUT OF ANY OPEN POSITIONS THEY HAD. ACCORDING TO FIRM STAFF, THE FIRM'S TRADING SYSTEM IN THE U.S. WOULD NOT SHUT DOWN UNTIL AFTER THE MARKET CLOSED, DEPENDING ON HOW QUICKLY TRADERS FLATTENED THEIR POSITIONS. THE FIRM, HOWEVER, FAILED TO IMPLEMENT ANY REVIEW OF TRADERS' TRADING ACTIVITY REASONABLY DESIGNED TO DETECT AND PREVENT MANIPULATION OF THE CLOSING PRICE OF A SECURITY. THE FIRM FAILED TO TAKE ANY STEPS TO TEST ITS TRADING WITH OTHERS REPORT (TWO REPORT). THE FIRM BECAME AWARE THAT THE TWO REPORT WAS NOT FUNCTIONING AS INTENDED IN CONNECTION WITH RESPONDING TO A FINRA INQUIRY. UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION, THE FIRM DISCOVERED THAT THE TWO REPORT MATERIALLY UNDERREPORTED THE NUMBER OF MATCHED TRADES EXECUTED BY TRADERS AS A RESULT OF A PROGRAMMING ERROR. THE PROGRAMMING FOR THE TWO REPORT WAS CORRECTED AND ALTHOUGH THE FIRM RERAN THE TWO REPORT, IT NEVER REVIEWED THE RERUN REPORTS TO DETERMINE WHETHER ANY TRADERS HAD ENGAGED IN A PATTERN OF MATCHED TRADES. DESPITE THE SIGNIFICANT ROLE PLAYED BY TRADER IDS IN FIRM SUPERVISORY AND RISK MONITORING SYSTEMS, THE FIRM HAD NO EFFECTIVE CONTROLS RELATING TO THE DE-ACTIVATION OF TRADER IDS BELONGING TO TERMINATED TRADERS, NOR DID THE FIRM HAVE CONTROLS TO ENSURE TRADER IDS WERE USED EXCLUSIVELY BY THE PERSONS TO WHOM THEY WERE ISSUED. AS A RESULT OF THIS SITUATION, TRADERS POTENTIALLY WERE ABLE TO CIRCUMVENT THE SUPERVISORY AND RISK CONTROLS TIED TO TRADER IDS, INCLUDING: CONTINUING TO TRADE AFTER THEIR OWN TRADER IDS WERE DISABLED DUE TO LOSSES BY USING OTHER TRADER IDS, AND CONTINUING TO TRADE AFTER THEY WERE SUSPENDED FOR DISCIPLINARY REASONS BY ENTERING TRADES USING OTHER TRADER IDS.

    "So that's the basic functionality. After improving the quality of LDA and TSNE, the next useful step would probably be to try a different visualization method, like PCA. I suspect the TSNE output right now is a little too neat. There will probably be a lot more overlap, so then I'll want to enable muting parts of the legend. I also really want to make it 3D, but Bokeh doesn't have that support yet. Plotly does, and surprisingly Matplotlib too!\n"
